    <p>A pattern used to restrict the list of projects available to this navigator</p>
    <p>
        If you want to restrict the list to projects of a specific group, you could just enter the group's name here.
        The value entered here will be used for the query-parameter "search" of the gitlab-api;
        see the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#list-projects">documentation</a> for details.
